*** Still need to figure out how we want to handle:

- alcoholic beverages prefix
- Campbell's (and probably some other existing brand names) (which seem to always be in all caps)
- baby food ingredients have meal names in the ingredient names
- "Candies" prefix
- Some ingredients are just weird to read, like: "cake, yellow, dry mix, white"...



* I wonder if we should just use the "ingredient_categories" as the actual ingredients. It seems like a much more concise list.
